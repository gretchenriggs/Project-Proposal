# Nature or Not? - Detection of Man-Made Structure from Satellite Imagery

After reading about the U.S. discovery of the installation of nuclear-armed Soviet missiles in Cuba via aerial photographs back in 1962 and also the use of aerial images to discern damage done by bombs, as well as designating targets, during World War II, I became interested in other uses of aerial or satellite images.
Training a convolutional neural network to discern between natural & and man-made structures in satellite images from around the globe.
